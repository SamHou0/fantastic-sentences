## What is this?
Have you ever thought of some fantastic sentences from an anime, but regretted not writing them down at the time?

Or maybe, you’re looking for some sentences to make your writing more interesting?

That's why this repository exists! This repository contains everything you need—from memorable lines from anime to famous quotes by celebrities, it’s all here.

## But why can't I found the sentences I want?
What?! You can’t find what you want? Well, I have to admit that this repository is indeed sparse, as this is not a single-person job! You’re welcome to add any sentences you like to this repository. Please submit a PR directly!

## Author’s Limitations
